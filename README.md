 ## Synopsis/Project details
  To make easier for content creators to sell there merchandise, and for customers too. this website have integrated payment gateway and has beautiful UI for great user experience For completion of this website we had used some of the core azure services such as Static Webapps Visual Studio Code.

  For deploying a static webapp using Azure Static web app service we have to make a resource group in my case it was "MerchStore" and connect to github account in order to access repositories. Azure creates a github actions .yaml file in ".github/Workflows/ " which automatically detects a new commit and run a github actions workflow and the changes reflects on the actual website.
